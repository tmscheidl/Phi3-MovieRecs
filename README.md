# LLM-Based Movie Recommender Systems

This repository contains practical work focused on developing and evaluating multiple movie recommender system models using large language models (LLMs). The objective is to explore diverse recommendation strategies—from genre-based filtering to chain-of-thought (COT) explanation-enhanced approaches—aimed at improving accuracy, diversity, and transparency in movie recommendations.
